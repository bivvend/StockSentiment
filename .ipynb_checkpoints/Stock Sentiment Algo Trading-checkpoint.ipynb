You can read it on Bill Clinton's face.\"SEPARATE EFFORT ON FACEBOOKFacebook said the effort originating in Vietnam was traced to the multi-language media group Epoch Times, which is linked to the Falun Gong spiritual movement, and a US media outlet called BL, which has been posting pro-Trump messages.The California-based company added that it removed more than 600 accounts on Facebook and Instagram.\"The people behind this activity made widespread use of fake accounts -- many of which had been automatically removed by our systems -- to manage pages and groups, automate posting at very high frequencies and direct traffic to off-platform sites,\" Facebook security chief Nathaniel Gleicher said.\"The BL-focused network repeatedly violated a number of our policies, including our policies against coordinated inauthentic behaviour, spam and misrepresentation, to name just a few.\"The accounts posted memes and other content on conservative ideology and hot button US political issues including Trump's impeachment, elections, trade, family values and freedom of religion, Gleicher said.STRUGGLING AGAINST STATE ACTORSBoth Facebook and Twitter have in the past acted against manipulation efforts from Russia, Iran and other countries.A recent report by the Oxford Internet Institute found manipulation efforts have doubled over the past two years and are being used in 56 countries.The researchers said \"sophisticated state actors\" from at least seven countries are working outside their borders on global foreign influence operations, using Facebook and Twitter.The report identified the countries as China, India, Iran, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.AFP[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...CREATIVE Technology on Thursday said it will be launching its new Super X-Fi Gen2, an improved version of the Super ...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "[SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook Inc acquired a small video-shopping startup earlier this year to help build a live shopping feature inside the company's Marketplace product, according to a person familiar with the plans.The social media company bought Packagd, a five-person company founded by Eric Feng, a former partner with Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, and most of the startup's team joined Facebook in September. Packagd was building a shopping product for YouTube videos. \"Think of it as a re-imagination of QVC or a home shopping network,\" Mr Feng said in a 2017 interview with Bloomberg Television's Emily Chang.The acquisition by Facebook wasn't announced, but the small team is now working on a project for Marketplace, which would let users make purchases while watching live video broadcasts. Facebook tested a similar product a year ago in Thailand, though that effort didn't include a way to buy merchandise directly from the video and has been shut down, a person familiar with the matter said.A Facebook spokesman confirmed the efforts. \"As we've shared in the past, we're exploring ways to let buyers easily ask questions and place orders within a live video broadcast,\" she said in a statement.\n",

The drives also included compensation information, including salaries, bonus amounts, and some equity details.In total, the drives contained personal data of about 29,000 US employees who worked at Facebook in 2018, a spokeswoman confirmed.

      "But Mr Morrison said stronger proposals to police some of the 21st century's biggest corporate titans would \"need further consideration and engagement\" given the \"complexity of the issues and the potential to have economy-wide effects\".They included opening up commercially sensitive algorithms to outside scrutiny and introducing \"sufficiently large sanctions\" to deter platforms from misusing data or spreading disinformation.Google and Facebook have had a huge impact on Australia's news industry, with the number of newspaper and online journalists falling more than 20 per cent since 2014, as digital advertising revenues were overwhelmingly captured by the two tech titans.Mr Morrison directed the ACCC to work with tech giants and media companies on the creation of a voluntary code of conduct to \"address bargaining power imbalances\" between the two sides.The measures follow an 18-month inquiry into the power of digital platforms by the ACCC, which welcomed the government's response on Thursday.\"The world is waking up to the very real harms that stem from the power the digital platforms hold in our society and for our economy,\" ACCC chair Rod Sims said.DIGI - a lobby group for tech companies including Facebook, Google, Twitter - said it would be \"studying the proposals in detail to ensure that the consumer protections are fit for a digital era, and that there are no unintended consequences for Australia's digital future, economic growth and global competitiveness\".An estimated 17 million Australians use Facebook each month and spend an average of 30 minutes on the platform a day, while 98 per cent of Australian mobile searches use Google.

      "Jay Sullivan, the privacy product chief for Messenger, told a congressional hearing on Tuesday Facebook was aware of its duty to work with law enforcement, pointing to the tech giant's assistance in terrorism and child abuse cases.RIGHTS ACTIVISTS BACK FACEBOOK Earlier Tuesday, more than 100 activist organisations, security experts and industry groups warned against efforts to force tech companies to weaken encryption.\"These exceptional access mechanisms for law enforcement agencies would be the same 'back doors' that provide an opportunity for terrorists, criminals, and other parties to gain unauthorised access,\" said the letter endorsed by groups including the American Civil Liberties Union, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch.\"Technologists cannot build systems that are inherently able to tell when 'bad' people use them, just as engineers cannot design sidewalks and highways to crumble underneath the feet of certain people.\"It said special access demands would \"embolden repressive and authoritarian regimes in their attempts to pressure messaging apps and device manufacturers to build surveillance capabilities into their products and services.\"LAW ENFORCEMENT HAMSTRUNG? A joint letter in October signed by US Attorney General William Barr, British Home Secretary Priti Patel and Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton urged Facebook to give authorities the ability to circumvent encryption used in its messaging services.The officials said strong encryption made it more difficult for law enforcement to detect terrorism and child pornography, and that a move to implement \"end-to-end\" encryption on its Messenger platform could make matters worse.\"Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens,\" said the October letter.At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, New York District Attorney Cyrus Vance echoed those concerns, and argued that investigations were being crippled by the failure to get access to encrypted messages and smartphones, which cannot be accessed even with a warrant.\"Unintended or not, the reality remains that these tech titans are doing tremendous damage to our justice system, particularly justice at the local and state levels, by choosing to render themselves incapable of complying with a judge's signed order,\" Mr Vance said.AFP[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "[SAN FRANCISCO] After Google announced restrictions on political advertising this week, campaign strategists in Washington quickly turned their attention to a different company: Facebook.Some strategists voiced concerns to Facebook about how Google's decision would affect it, said two people who talked to the company. They told Facebook that if it followed Google by limiting how political campaigns target audiences, it would hurt their ability to reach unregistered voters and make it tougher for smaller organisations to collect donations online, the people said.The conversations added to the pressure on Facebook as it weighs how to handle political advertising. Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, has made it clear that Facebook will run all political ads — even if they contain lies — in the interest of free speech. But the social network is discussing some ad changes, like restricting how precisely campaigns can reach specific groups, said three people briefed by the company.Facebook has made no final ruling on its political advertising guidelines, said the people, who declined to be identified because the discussions were confidential. On Thursday at a happy hour discussion with roughly 500 digital strategists, campaign officials and political operatives at Facebook's offices in Washington, company executives were adamant that they would not make any news about political ads, said two people who attended the event.\n",

      "\"Twitter fired the starting gun, and Google just cranked it up to 11,\" said Eric Wilson, a Republican digital advertising strategist. \"Now the pressure is on Facebook — they're going to have to act.\"Political advertising on social media and internet platforms has become particularly fraught in this election cycle because of how campaigns increasingly rely on the digital channels to spread their messages and reach voters. Yet few companies are getting caught in that fray as much as Facebook.On the one hand, the company wants to curtail the spread of disinformation across its site. At the same time, it wants to avoid alienating the groups and candidates who depend on its platform for fundraising and organising. So in trying to find a way to please everyone on the issue, Facebook has managed to please no one.The social network has now become an outlier in how freely it lets political candidates and elected officials advertise on its platform. While Mr Zuckerberg declared last month that Facebook would not police political ads, Twitter said it would ban all such ads because of their negative impact on civic discourse. On Wednesday, Google said it would no longer allow political ads to be directed to specific audiences based on people's public voter records or political affiliations.\"As we've said, we are looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads,\" a Facebook spokesman said in a statement.The pressure on Facebook over what to do about political ad targeting has been unrelenting. Organisations on both sides of the political aisle — from as large as President Donald Trump's reelection campaign to smaller, grassroots groups — have tried to persuade Facebook not to rein in the ad targeting.\"Making major changes to platform ad targeting would severely disadvantage Democrats and progressives who rely on Facebook for fundraising and currently have a much smaller organic audience and current database of supporters to engage on and off the platform than Donald Trump,\" said Tara McGowan, founder and chief executive of Acronym, a progressive nonprofit group.Some Republican strategists said they also feared losing the ability to raise significant campaign donations online if Facebook reduced ad targeting.On Friday, the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee issued a joint statement condemning Google's changes to its ad targeting policies.\"Tech companies should not reduce the power of the grassroots just because it is easier than addressing abuse on their platforms,\" the groups said in a memo to CNN. \"We call on these tech companies, including Google, to reconsider their decision to bluntly limit political advertising on their platforms.\"The company has been contacting ad buyers and advocacy groups for feedback on what changes to political ads, if any, they could stomach. In one recent call with political advertising groups, Facebook said it was considering some tweaks, such as the possibility of raising the minimum number of people who could be targeted to 1,000 from 100, according to two people familiar with the discussion. The potential change was earlier reported by The Wall Street Journal.Facebook also is updating and refining its advertising library, a collection of current and past ads that were paid for by political candidates, in an effort to increase transparency, the people said.NYTIMES[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "[WASHINGTON] Google's tightening of its political ad policy could help reduce the spread of misinformation on election campaigns, but at a cost for lesser-known candidates.The move by Google placing restrictions on how advertisers can target specific groups of voters also adds to the pressure on Facebook to modify its hands-off policy on political ads.Google announced on Wednesday it would not allow political advertisers to use \"microtargeting\" which can be based on user browsing data, political affiliation or other factors, for its ads, including on YouTube.Instead it will limit targeting to general categories such as age, gender or postal code location. The changes will be enforced in Britain within a week and in the rest of the world starting in January.\n",

      "\"There are no carve-outs,\" Google vice-president Scott Spencer said.\"It's against our policies for any advertiser to make a false claim - whether it's a claim about the price of a chair or a claim that you can vote by text message, that election day is postponed, or that a candidate has died.\"The move follows a ban by Twitter on most kinds of political ads, and comes amid growing pressure on internet platforms to curb the spread of misinformation around political campaigns.FACEBOOK ISOLATED Senator Ron Wyden welcomed the Google move, saying it could reduce the number of deceptive ads which are sent to small segments of users, including from foreign entities.\"Targeted influence campaigns are more effective and more cost-effective than blanket propaganda, and far harder to identify and expose,\" Mr Wyden said.\"Now that Google and Twitter have taken responsible steps to guard against shadowy political influence campaigns, Facebook should do the same.\"Karen Kornbluh, director of the digital innovation democracy initiative at the German Marshall Fund, called Google's move \"a critically important step in taking this political disinformation weapon off the table,\" but warned that the different rules for various platforms could lead to confusion.Michelle Amazeen, a Boston University professor who follows political advertising, said Google's actions were \"small steps in the right direction that serve to chip away at the tsunami of disinformation fostered by the current architecture of digital-social media platforms.\"Analysts noted that Facebook, which has rejected efforts to fact-check political speech or ads, will be pressured to make a similar move that could have even more far-reaching consequences.Facebook said in a tweet late on Wednesday it was \"looking at different ways we might refine our approach to political ads,\" without elaborating.SHIFTING DIGITAL STRATEGIES But political strategists from both parties warned that the changes by Google are likely to help well-financed and incumbent candidates and may not have the intended effect.\"This change won't curb disinformation, but it will hinder campaigns and others who are already working against the tide of bad actors to reach voters with facts,\" said Tara McGowan, founder of the progressive advocacy group Acronym which has launched a US$75 million digital campaign.Eric Wilson, a Republican digital strategist, said new candidates will be hampered in their ability to raise funds and build voter lists - a key element on online campaigns even before the \"persuasion\" phase.\"The big disappointment on this is you're going to have campaign spending go to platforms that are less transparent that will allow you to target voters more narrowly. The dollars won't go away.\"Mark Jablonowski, managing partner and chief technology officer of the digital consultancy DSPolitical, which works with Democrats, said Google's efforts create a patchwork of different rules that will favor incumbents.\"In the absence of sensible, implementable federal regulations, companies like Google have adopted misguided policies that will do little more than benefit incumbents, the wealthy, and those who rely on targeting largely monolithic Republican constituencies,\" he said.President Donald Trump's campaign director Brad Parscale responded to the Google action by tweeting that \"political elites & Big Tech want to rig elections..

      "When it comes to detecting hate speech, Facebook software now automatically finds 80 per cent of the content removed; this is a big improvement from two years ago, when nearly all such material was not dealt with until being reported by users, said the California-based firm.Mr Zuckerberg noted that hate speech is tougher for AI to detect than nudity in images or video because of \"linguistic nuances\" that require context that could make even common words menacing.Add to that videos of attacks driven by bias against a race, gender or religion could be shared to condemn such violence rather than glorify it.People at Facebook continue to try to share video of a horrific mosque attacks in Christchurch, New Zealand, with social network systems blocking 95 per cent of those attempts, said executives.A lone gunman opened fire on two mosques in the city of Christchurch, killing and wounding scores of Muslims in March - while he broadcast the assaults live on Facebook.Facebook has terrorism experts as part of a team of more than 350 people devoted to preventing terrorist groups from using the social network, said head of global policy management Monika Bickert.Systems honed to find and delete banned content on Facebook are also being used at Instagram, which has ramped up efforts to filter out content likely to encourage suicide or self harm, while allowing people to share such traumatic experiences in the spirit of recovery or healing. Rules put in place recently at Instagram added drawings and other fictional content to the list to a ban on images that might encourage suicide or self harm.The Facebook-owned image and video-sharing service early this year clamped down on images of self-injury after a British teen who had gone online to read about suicide took her own life in 2017.The 14-year-old's social media history revealed that she followed accounts about depression and suicide. The case sparked a vigorous debate in Britain about parental control and state regulation of children's social media use.Instagram has never allowed posts that promote or encourage suicide or self-harm.With a rule change early this year, it began removing references to non-graphic content related to people hurting themselves from its searches and recommendation features.The measures were meant to make such images more difficult to find for depressed teens who might have suicidal tendencies.

      "AMERICANS don't have to be beholden to the tech Goliaths to get the benefits of artificial intelligence. An alternative possibility is for the government to provide the infrastructure needed for a technological future - through a public option for artificial intelligence.Big tech companies have an extraordinary amount of data about how we behave, largely because they engage in widespread surveillance of much of our behaviour. Because AI depends on data, these companies have a huge market advantage over startups and entrepreneurs - and it's a gap that will only get wider. The lax regulatory environment hasn't helped, either; instead, it has allowed the biggest tech companies to acquire their rivals, stifle competition and snatch up the best software engineers and data scientists. Together, these dynamics make it hard for startups, governments and non-profits to develop and use artificial intelligence without relying on big tech companies, effectively ceding influence over this developing field to a private sphere distorted by anti-competitive practices.The alternative is a public option for AI.The public option, a familiar term from debates over healthcare, is a public programme that provides universal access to goods and services, with a private opt-out. A public option for AI wouldn't prevent companies such as Google from collecting and using data. But it would provide a pathway for startups and public-sector organisations to develop abilities and products that would compete with those of the tech giants.\n",

      "THREE COMPONENTSOur proposal has three components: The first is a public data pool that would make data accessible to registered users. Local, state and federal governments have sizeable data resources that would seed this digital commons. Users would be verified to block foreign governments, hackers and others with ill motives from access, and users would be prevented from using the data to engage in racial or other forms of discrimination and for micro-targeted advertising.Some of the data may be very sensitive, and access to those resources would be highly regulated. We can imagine a variety of ways that regulation and technology together could protect privacy and still foster innovation: Data could be anonymised at the source; the commons could have an interface that allowed users to derive insight from the data set, while leaving the underlying information inaccessible; less sensitive data, such as weather information, could be made available in a format optimised for training AI.What's more, methods for safely sharing AI models without disclosing the underlying data are being developed today and could enable users of the data commons to collaborate on public-interest AI services. The federal government should also invest in researching new and better ways to protect privacy and prevent misuse.Second, a public option for artificial intelligence would include a significant increase in research and development spending. Proponents of big tech celebrate private-sector research and are right to do so. But big tech companies, like all companies, have an incentive to fund research that will support their bottom-line, and the profit motive doesn't always mean a focus on the most important problems.GROUNDBREAKING WORKFor generations, government R&D spending has been one of the central engines of economic growth and technological progress in America. Yet, China is projected to spend far more than the United States on AI research over the next decade. A sizeable increase in research funding for companies, governments and non-profits developing public-interest technologies would help expand the types of research taking place and give scientists and engineers the option to do groundbreaking work on a broader range of problems.Third, much of government's AI work takes place in the military sector and is applied to national security problems. But healthcare, transportation, energy and other areas could also benefit significantly from AI. The federal government should expand its AI procurement across all of these sectors as an opportunity to improve public services for all Americans. In addition, the government should ensure that its use of algorithms meets the highest ethical standards.A public option for AI can't solve every problem related to technology and surveillance, and it would require careful thinking about public governance of these programmes - including a commitment to privacy and awareness of biases. But it would help address the problem of a small number of companies having virtually all power over this technology. It would facilitate the conditions for a competitive market with many players and many new innovations, all while preserving our democratic values and improving our society.

      "THERE is still a future for Facebook’s embattled digital currency Libra, even if central banks around the world decide to create their own digital currencies, said Christian Catalini, co-creator of Libra and head economist of Calibra, a digital currency wallet that is a subsidiary of Facebook.“From the start, it was clear to us that eventually central banks will be issuing some flavours of central bank digital currency, and we wanted the system to be future-proofed for that,” he told a packed audience at the Singapore FinTech Festival and Singapore Week of Innovation and TeCHnology (SFF x SWITCH) panel discussion on Tuesday.Libra would have built on those central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), he added. But the challenge was that there was hardly any precedent to ride on.Libra was a particularly hot topic during the 45-minute long discussion, given that it has faced intense scrutiny and backlash from the get-go. It is known as a “stablecoin”, or cryptocurrencies that are pegged to a basket of fiat currencies, securities or commodities, so as to reduce the price volatility. Almost a quarter of the grouping originally backing the Libra project has departed, including payments firms Visa and Mastercard.\n",

      "“The Libra reserve, and all the thinking that went into ensuring that actually Libra is based on assets that are managed, controlled and generated by central banks, is very much a complement to monetary policy,” he said, but did not elaborate on how.Even if CBDCs do come into the picture, it would help to streamline the operations of Libra, which was meant to be a payment network, he said.It “wouldn’t make sense” to abandon Libra in that scenario as it will be even more effective, allowing greater focus on enabling cheap and fast payments on top of the central bank issued assets, added Mr Catalini.Mr Catalini was speaking on a panel together with Serey Chea, assistant governor and director general of central banking, National Bank of Cambodia; Mu Changchun, director-general, Institute of Digital Currency, People’s Bank of China; and Umar Farooq, head of digital treasury services and head of blockchain CIB, JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPMorgan’s Mr Farooq said that, on the contrary, he would be tempted to kill the JPMorgan coin, if the US Fed comes up with its own digital currency. That being said, he added the caveat that it has to be “well designed”, otherwise it could result in the current commercial banking system that runs the world to be at risk.In February, JPMorgan was the first US bank to create a digital coin based on blockchain technology to enable the instantaneous transfer of payments between institutional clients.

      "But this can't possibly be the outcome you and I want, to have crazy lies pumped into the water supply that corrupt the most important decisions we make together. Lies that have a very real and incredibly dangerous effect on our elections and our lives and our children's lives.Don't say Larry Flynt. Not even Larry Flynt would say Larry Flynt. This isn't the same as pornography, which people don't rely upon for information. Half of all Americans say Facebook is their main source of news. Of course, the problem could be solved by those people going to a different news source, or you could decide to make Facebook a reliable source of public information.The tagline on the artwork for The Social Network read, in 2010, \"You don't get to 500 million friends without making a few enemies.\" That number sounds quaint just nine years later because one-third of the planet uses your website now.And right now, on your website, is an ad claiming that Joe Biden gave the Ukrainian attorney general a billion dollars not to investigate his son. Every square inch of that is a lie and it's under your logo. That's not defending free speech, Mark. That's assaulting truth.You and I want speech protections to make sure no one gets imprisoned or killed for saying or writing something unpopular, not to ensure that lies have unfettered access to the American electorate.Even after the screenplay for The Social Network satisfied the standards of Sony's legal department, we sent the script - as promised over a handshake - to a group of senior lieutenants at your company and invited them to give notes. (I was asked if I would change the name of Harvard University to something else and if Facebook had to be called Facebook.)After we'd shot the movie, we arranged a private screening of an early cut for your chief operating officer (COO) Sheryl Sandberg. Ms Sandberg stood up in the middle of the screening, turned to the producers who were standing at the back of the room, and said: \"How can you do this to a kid?\" (You were 27 years old at the time, but all right, I get it.)I hope your COO walks into your office, leans in (as she suggested we do in her best-selling book), and says: \"How can we do this to tens of millions of kids? Are we really going to run an ad that claims Kamala Harris ran dog fights out of the basement of a pizza place while Elizabeth Warren destroyed evidence that climate change is a hoax and the deep state sold meth to Rashida Tlaib and Colin Kaepernick?\"The law hasn't been written yet - yet - that holds carriers of user-generated Internet content responsible for the user-generated content they carry, just like movie studios, television networks and book, magazine and newspaper publishers. Ask Peter Thiel, who funded a defamation suit against Gawker that bankrupted the site and forced it to close down. (You should have Mr Thiel's number in your phone because he was an early investor in Facebook).Fact-checkingMost people don't have the resources to employ a battalion of fact checkers. Nonetheless, at a congressional committee two weeks ago, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked you the following: \"Do you see a potential problem here with a complete lack of fact-checking on political advertisements?\" Then, when she pushed you further, asking you if Facebook would or would not take down lies, you answered: \"Congresswoman, in most cases, in a democracy, I believe people should be able to see for themselves what politicians they may or may not vote for are saying and judge their character for themselves.\"Now you tell me.

If Facebook employees get it so should Zuckerberg,\" tweeted Senator Richard Blumenthal.Facebook said in response to an AFP query about the controversy that the social media giant remained \"committed to not censoring political speech, and we will continue exploring additional steps we can take to bring increased transparency to political ads.\"Meanwhile, Twitter on Wednesday announced it would stop running political ads all together.Mr Zuckerberg recently faced a torrent of criticism on Capitol Hill over the Libra cryptocurrency Facebook is seeking to roll out next year.\"We clearly have not locked down exactly how this is going to work yet,\" Mr Zuckerberg told members of the House Financial Service Committee.\"The goal of Libra is to build a global payment system rather than a currency.\"He acknowledged that Libra could be limited to digital payment systems using individual currencies - a less ambitious plan than creating a new coin linked to a basket of major currencies.Libra is backed by an alliance of companies in a nonprofit, Swiss-based association, but some lawmakers are skeptical about the project, and want Facebook instead to focus on data privacy.Lawmakers did not hold back in their harsh criticism of Facebook's data practices and doubts about Libra in particular.AFP[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "\"We feel acute responsibility because there's obviously an awareness that the internet has disrupted the news industry business model,\" Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, said in an interview. \"We've figured out a different way to do this that we think is going to be better and more sustainable.\"Facebook will pay for a range of content from dozens of publishers — including striking some deals well into the millions of dollars — and get local news from smaller publishers in metropolitan markets like Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami and Atlanta.\"Mark Zuckerberg seems personally and professionally committed to ensuring that high-quality journalism has a viable, valued future,\" Robert Thomson, chief executive of News Corp, said in a statement. \"It is absolutely appropriate that premium journalism is recognized and rewarded.\"The relationship between Facebook and publishers has been strained. Because Facebook and Google dominate the online advertising market, taking in together as much as 80 per cent of the revenue, publishers have viewed the tech giants as stymieing their digital expansions.Facebook has over the years courted publishers for different journalism initiatives, like Instant Articles — a product in which publishers provided articles that appeared entirely within Facebook — and Facebook Live, which paid newsrooms to hire teams of journalists to use and promote Facebook's live video products.But those relationships soured as Facebook often shifted its strategy, leaving publishers feeling abused when the social network abandoned its original plans.After heavily promoting partnerships for video projects, for instance, Facebook decided not to renew some video deals with publishers — with catastrophic effects.Mic, a digital publisher aimed at targeting news-hungry millennials, was forced to sell itself at a deeply discounted valuation after its video content deals were not renewed by Facebook.Mr Zuckerberg acknowledged the tension between Facebook and publishers, and he said past experiences informed his current approach.\"It's not a one-time thing,\" he said of the new partnerships with publishers. \"That's why the deals we are structuring are long-term commitments, not two months, not one year, but multiple years.\"He added, \"We think we've worked out the formula through all these conversations where we now can sustainably pay for content.\"The new Facebook News effort is being led by Campbell Brown, a veteran television journalist who covered politics for NBC and CNN before joining Facebook as head of news partnerships.Most of the publishing industry's recent financial struggles can be traced to a shift toward digital ad revenue, which has not compensated for the loss of print ad revenue.Although the tech giants are not the only reason that publishers' revenues have eroded, even small tweaks in Facebook's algorithms have an outsize effect on publishers' web traffic.So when publishers designed their corporate strategies around the whims of the Facebook News Feed, their traffic sometimes plummeted when Facebook changed tack.Facebook is not alone in now choosing to elevate original reporting. Last month, Google announced that it would give priority to articles that broke news or that had invested considerable resources into reporting over imitative aggregation.Google made clear that the decision was not purely altruistic. Highlighting original reporting, an executive suggested, would make users more likely to trust Google and keep going back to the search goliath.In March, Apple also introduced a paid news subscription product, Apple News Plus, which provides articles from an array of publishers and costs $10 a month.But many publishers balked at Apple's terms when it asked for a 50% cut of all subscription revenue earned. Though News Corp. joined Apple's product, other companies — including The Times and The Washington Post — did not.With Facebook News, the social network said it wanted to avoid some missteps of past news products, which relied heavily on algorithmically generated suggestions without any selection from professional journalists.\"People want and benefit from personalised experiences on Facebook, but we know there is reporting that transcends individual experience,\" Brown said in a blog post. \"We want to support both.\"NYTimes[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "\"I personally am much more focused on being able to help innovate and build a global payment system than I am in any specific makeup of what a currency or reserve might look like,\" he said.Libra is backed by an alliance of companies in a nonprofit, Swiss-based association, but some lawmakers are skeptical about the project, and want Facebook instead to focus on data privacy.Mr Zuckerberg repeated his pledge that the digital coin would not launch without full regulatory approvals and added that Facebook would quit the alliance if it launches prematurely.Asked whether Libra could simply be linked to the US dollar, Mr Zuckerberg said \"the community is fairly split on this point.\"He said that it could be far simpler from a regulatory perspective but that \"it may be less welcome in other places if it's only 100 per cent based on the dollar.\"FACEBOOK UNDER FIRE Lawmakers did not hold back in their harsh criticism of Facebook's data practices and doubts about Libra in particular.\"It would be beneficial for all if Facebook concentrates on addressing its many existing deficiencies and failures before proceeding any further on the Libra project,\" Representative Maxine Waters, who chairs the panel, said at the opening.On Twitter, Ms Waters ramped up her criticism of Facebook and pledged to block the digital currency plan.\"No one is above the law including Mark Zuckerberg,\" Ms Waters tweeted.\"Facebook has allowed election interference, released private data, violated civil rights laws, among other offenses & now they're trying to launch a #BigTechTakeover by creating this mysterious #ZuckBuck? Not on my watch!\"Several other lawmakers also took the occasion to question the trustworthiness of the world's largest social network.\"In order to make a decision about Libra, we need to kind to dig into your past behaviour and Facebook's behaviour with respect to our democracy,\" said Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who peppered Mr Zuckerberg with questions about the Cambridge Analytica scandal and Facebook's decision not to fact-check political ads.Republican Representative Patrick McHenry offered a more sympathetic view, suggesting the Libra plan should be given the benefit of the doubt given that similar plans are being made in China and elsewhere.\"I have my qualms about Facebook and Libra ... but if history has taught us anything, it's better to be on the side of American innovation,\" Mr McHenry said.CHINA VS AMERICAN 'LEADERSHIP' In his prepared remarks, Mr Zuckerberg argued that the digital currency plan could help \"extend America's financial leadership\" and promote democratic values as other digital currencies emerge.During questioning, Mr Zuckerberg noted that a major competitive threat is coming from a Chinese public-private partnership and warned of risks if such a system became the global standard.If that happens, he said, \"it would be very difficult if not impossible for us to impose our sanctions or the kinds of protections\" US policymakers would like to see.Mr Zuckerberg was also grilled by several lawmakers on why the Libra Association is based in Switzerland rather than the United States.He said Switzerland is important for the global financial system but added: \"This is still going to be an American innovation.\"Republican Representative Lance Gooden countered that Mr Zuckerberg had \"enough influence to bring this home\" and said the plan might be better received if the association were based in the US.Regulators and officials on both sides of the Atlantic have criticised the Libra plan.The G-7 said last week it should not launch \"until the legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks are adequately addressed.\"US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday a Libra launch would be \"premature,\" raising the need to address issues such as protection against money laundering and other illicit activity.AFP[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "Libra is just one item on the growing list of issues that has put the social-media company in the spotlight; others include repeated privacy lapses, allowing its platform to be exploited and questions about whether it bought rivals to quash competition.In just the past two years, the company has acknowledged the unauthorised use of private-user information by a political data firm, shut down several state-backed disinformation campaigns, been targeted with multiple antitrust investigations and been hammered for taking money to publish false political advertising, including trading barbs with 2020 presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren.Facebook also failed to get blessings from US regulators before unveiling a plan to launch Libra.Amy Webb, a consultant and professor at the New York University Stern School of Business, said: \"The company has made terrible strategic and tactical decisions in the past year, which have ranged from how it communicated with everyday people to decisions made about what content to allow as it relates to politics and the election. It was in a bad position to begin with, but I don't think it has managed it well.\"Some congressional staffers said Facebook's hiring so many lobbyists in Libra's early days backfired as the lobbyists reached out with overlapping requests to meet with them or the lawmakers they worked for.Facebook's internal lobbyists regularly blanketed staffers with generic emails which one staffer described as \"spam\" and impersonal, rather than building relationships.In June, Facebook turned up the heat further with its Libra announcement. It said the project, which originally included 28 partners such as Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc, could launch as soon as 2020, surprising lawmakers and regulators.While Facebook was one of the only original Libra partners willing to publicly support the project, staffers said they were sometimes confused when company executives cautioned that they couldn't make commitments on behalf of the then 28-member Libra Association.Seven of the original members dropped out this month as the association finalised its charter and governance structure.The Libra Association hired its own lobbyist, Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, last month, according to a federal disclosure released on Monday. Facebook's outside lobbyists in the third quarter included Harbinger Strategies and Peck Madigan Jones, among other firms.Even as its lobbyists blanketed Capitol Hill on Libra and other issues, Facebook initially resisted calls for its senior executives to testify before congressional committees, said some staffers.A Facebook spokesman pointed out that company executives have testified 16 times before 10 committees since October 2017.Now, Mr Zuckerberg is taking some of the lobbying push into his own hands. Wednesday's hearing was to be his third public appearance in Washington in the past month and his first time testifying since he appeared at House and Senate committee hearings in April 2018.At Wednesday's hearing, he plans to acknowledge some of the company's missteps and that the furore of the past two years will make projects such as Libra difficult to pull off.\"I believe this is something that needs to get built, but I understand we're not the ideal messenger right now,\" he said on Libra in his written testimony.\"We've faced a lot of issues over the past few years, and I'm sure people wish it was anyone but Facebook putting this idea forward.\" BLOOMBERG[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "\"Private sector entities that design stablecoin arrangements are expected to address a wide array of legal, regulatory and oversight challenges and risks,\" the report added.The report underscores concern among global policymakers about stablecoins such as Libra, and presents a further headache for Facebook's project after a chastening week.In response, the Libra Association that backs the cryptocurrency effort said it was committed to working with regulators.Libra was designed to respect national sovereignty over monetary policy, as well as rules against money laundering and other efforts to stop illicit finances, it said in a statement. \"Libra is being designed to work with existing regulatory institutions and apply the protections they provide to the digital world - not disrupt, or undermine, them,\" it said.Amid sharp regulatory scrutiny, the 21 firms backing Libra pledged on Monday to forge ahead with the project, shrugging off the defection of a quarter of its original members, including payments giants Visa and Mastercard, this month.In June, Facebook unveiled Libra, a form of stablecoin backed by currencies from the dollar to the euro and government debt, in one of the most high-profile attempts to draw cryptocurrencies into the banking and corporate establishment their creators sought to subvert.Stablecoins aim to overcome the extreme volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and makes them impractical for commerce and payments.Yet Libra drew immediate and sustained criticism. Policymakers voiced concern about its potential to destabilise the global financial system and erode nations' control of monetary policy. Others said it could undermine users' privacy.The G-7 report said authorities should apply to stablecoins existing rules on payments and anti-money laundering, as well as capital market and banking standards.It added that new rules may be needed to deal with the emerging technology, with the Financial Stability Board - a body created after the 2008 financial crisis - assessing related regulatory issues before reporting to the Group of 20 wealthy nations in April.Stablecoins had before Libra attracted virtually no attention from global policymakers, partly because of their tiny size. The biggest, Tether, is only a fraction of the size of bitcoin, the No1 cryptocurrency.Facebook says Libra is designed to address inefficiencies in the global payments system, which is beset by high fees, lengthy transfer times and a lack of reliability. That hinders, and in many cases prevents, people from making cross-border payments, especially in developing countries.The G-7 said central banks, finance ministries and other authorities should work to tackle these weaknesses in payments systems. The public sector, it said, should step up efforts to bring into the financial system people lacking access to banking services.It added that central banks, by themselves and in cooperation, should look at issuing their own digital currencies.

      "The exodus followed warnings from politicians and regulators, from the United States to Europe, that Libra risked upsetting global financial stability, undermining users' privacy and facilitating money laundering.The latest withdrawals followed the departure of PayPal Holdings Inc from the Libra Association earlier this month. It leaves Facebook without the backing of any major payments firms for the project, due to launch by June 2020.Mr Disparte acknowledged that the digital currency's regulatory issues could push back its launch date.At the meeting in Geneva, members agreed on interim articles of association laying out how the organisation will be governed, as required by Swiss law, according to a fact sheet provided by the Libra Association.Most decisions will require a majority vote of the group's governing council, although changes to membership or management of the reserve would require a two-third supermajority.The group elected five people to serve on the board, including Facebook's David Marcus as well as representatives from PayU, venture firm Andreessen Horowitz, blockchain company Xapo Holdings Limited and non-profit Kiva Microfunds.The association's other prominent remaining members include Vodafone Group Plc and ride-hailing firms Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc. Its only payments firm remaining is Netherlands-based PayU, which according to its website does not operate in the United States, Canada or large swathes of Africa and the Middle East.The departure of major financial firms means Facebook can no longer count on a global player to help consumers turn their currency into Libra and facilitate transactions.This presents a new stumbling block for Libra's efforts to convince regulators and politicians about the coin's safety. France pledged last month to block Libra from operating in Europe, while the Bank of England laid out high hurdles it must meet before its launch.

      "But instead the list has shrunk, after more of its initial backers walked away amid swelling criticism from regulators around the world.Credit card giants Visa and Mastercard, online marketplace eBay and digital payments firm Stripe each announced Friday they had changed their minds about being founding members of the association, following a similar recent announcement by digital payments firm PayPal.The Libra Association confirmed on Friday that the companies would no longer be founding members, but said it would continue building an alliance of businesses, social-good organisations, and others to implement the cryptocurrency.Its launch was originally planned for mid 2020, but Mr Perez said he had not ruled out a later start date.\"What we want is to build a platform that is solid, that is there to last and that will survive in the long term,\" he said, adding he was still \"optimistic\" about reaching around 100 members as planned.THREAT TO FINANCIAL STABILITY? The membership departures came after US senators sent letters to several financial firms noting that they could face \"a high level of scrutiny from regulators\" if they participated in the new currency plan.French economy and finance minister Bruno Le Maire has warned that under current circumstances, Libra posed a threat to the \"monetary sovereignty\" of governments and could not be authorised in Europe.Facebook executives have, however, claimed the new digital coin could help lower costs for global money transfers and help those without access to the banking system.Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg is set to testify at an October 23 hearing in the US House of Representatives on the Libra plan.But in a fresh blow, a draft G-7 report has outlined nine major risks posed by such digital currencies, according to the BBC.The report, due to be presented to finance ministers at International Monetary Fund's annual meeting this week, did not single out Libra but referred to \"global stablecoins\" with the potential to \"scale rapidly\" as posing a range of potential problems.Stablecoins are seen as more steady than cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, since they are pegged to traditional currencies such as the US dollar or the euro.But the G-7 draft report reportedly cautioned that such currencies could pose problems for policymakers setting interest rates, and could threaten financial stability if users suddenly suffer \"loss of confidence\" in the digital unit.Randal Quarles, the head of the Financial Stability Board (FSB), which oversees regulation among G20 economies, also sent a letter to G-20 finance ministers Sunday warning that \"global stablecoins could pose a host of challenges to the regulatory community\".This, he wrote, was \"not least because they have the potential to become systemically important, including through the substitution of domestic currencies\".\"Stablecoin projects of potentially global reach and magnitude must meet the highest regulatory standards and be subject to prudential supervision and oversight,\" he insisted.AFP[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "Facebook has artificial intelligence experts on the job at one of its research labs in Paris.Up to 200 languages are currently used on Facebook, said Antoine Bordes, European co-director of fundamental AI research for the social network.Automatic translation is currently based on having large databases of identical texts in both languages to work from. But for many language pairs there just aren't enough such parallel texts.That's why researchers have been looking for another method, like the system developed by Facebook which creates a mathematical representation for words.Each word becomes a \"vector\" in a space of several hundred dimensions. Words that have close associations in the spoken language also find themselves close to each other in this vector space.\"For example, if you take the words 'cat' and 'dog', semantically, they are words that describe a similar thing, so they will be extremely close together physically\" in the vector space, said Guillaume Lample, one of the system's designers.\"If you take words like Madrid, London, Paris, which are European capital cities, it's the same idea.\"These language maps can then be linked to one another using algorithms - at first roughly, but eventually becoming more refined, until entire phrases can be matched without too many errors.Mr Lample said results are already promising.For the language pair of English-Romanian, Facebook's current machine translation system is \"equal or maybe a bit worse\" than the word vector system, said Mr Lample.But for the rarer language pair of English-Urdu, where Facebook's traditional system doesn't have many bilingual texts to reference, the word vector system is already superior, he said.But could the method allow translation from, say, Basque into the language of an Amazonian tribe?In theory, yes, said Mr Lample, but in practice a large body of written texts is needed to map the language, something lacking in Amazonian tribal languages. \"If you have just tens of thousands of phrases, it won't work. You need several hundreds of thousands,\" he said.Experts at France's CNRS national scientific centre said the approach Mr Lample has taken for Facebook could produce useful results, even if it doesn't result in perfect translations.Thierry Poibeau of CNRS's Lattice laboratory, which also does research into machine translation, called the word vector approach \"a conceptual revolution\".He said \"translating without parallel data\" - dictionaries or versions of the same documents in both languages - \"is something of the Holy Grail\" of machine translation.\"But the question is what level of performance can be expected\" from the word vector method, said Mr Poibeau. The method \"can give an idea of the original text\" but the capability for a good translation every time remains unproven.Francois Yvon, a researcher at CNRS's Computer Science Laboratory for Mechanics and Engineering Sciences, said \"the linking of languages is much more difficult\" when they are far removed from one another. \"The manner of denoting concepts in Chinese is completely different from French,\" he added.However even imperfect translations can be useful, said Mr Yvon, and could prove sufficient to track hate speech, a major priority for Facebook.

      "\"Our approach is grounded in Facebook's fundamental belief in free expression, respect for the democratic process, and the belief that, in mature democracies with a free press, political speech is already arguably the most scrutinised speech there is,\" Facebook's head of global elections policy Katie Harbath wrote.Both YouTube and Twitter told Reuters that the Trump campaign ad did not violate their policies.The Warren campaign advertisements, some of which feature a photo of Mr Zuckerberg and President Trump together, link to a petition supporting her plan to break up major tech companies such as Facebook, Alphabet Inc's Google and Amazon.com Inc , on antitrust grounds.\"Breaking news: Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook just endorsed Donald Trump for re-election,\" one advertisement reads. \"You're probably shocked, and you might be thinking, 'How could this possibly be true?' Well it's not. (Sorry.) But what Zuckerberg *has* done is given Donald Trump free rein to lie on his platform - and then to pay Facebook gobs of money to push out their lies to American voters.\"Ms Warren also attacked the policy in tweets earlier this week.In response to the Warren campaign ad, Trump campaign spokesman Gary Coby tweeted: \"Everyone knows Warren has lied to help her career. Now she's using a blatant lie (Zuck endorsement) as a straw man argument to restrict #FreeSpeech.\"Facebook said that the Federal Communications Commission does not want broadcast companies to censor candidates' speech and that the social media company agreed with FCC's view on the subject.Ms Warren reiterated that Facebook should hold itself to standards set forth in the company's policy. \"It's up to you whether you take money to promote lies. You can be in the disinformation-for-profit business, or you can hold yourself to some standards. In fact, those standards were in your policy.

      "[NEW YORK] Digital tax dodgers, take heed: International leaders have advanced a plan to prevent large multinational companies like Apple, Facebook and Amazon from avoiding taxes by shifting profits between countries.It's an effort to de-escalate a global battle over how to tax the digital economy.The framework proposal, released Wednesday by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), would allow countries to tax large multinationals even if they did not operate inside their borders. If international negotiators can now reach agreement on its key details, the plan will pave the way for new taxes not just on tech companies but on automakers and any other large multinational firms that operate online.Political and corporate leaders have clashed in recent years over how — and where — to tax companies that operate across national borders, particularly those that sell goods and services online.\n",

      "Many countries, particularly those in Europe, have moved to curb that practice by approving new taxes on large multinational companies that sell to their citizens but pay little or no tax to their countries. France approved a new digital tax this year that would hit large US tech companies like Google. The Trump administration responded by threatening tariffs on imported French goods, like wine, before the countries agreed to pause their plans in hopes of finding a multilateral agreement through the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.Wednesday's release brought an 18-page framework plan that officials hope will form the basis of an international agreement on digital taxation as early as next year. That framework would fundamentally alter how and where companies that operated across national borders were taxed, though it leaves the details of those tax rates to future negotiators. It suggests new rules on where companies should pay taxes — largely based on where their sales occur — and which profits are subject to taxation.\"In a digital age, the allocation of taxing rights can no longer be exclusively circumscribed by reference to physical presence,\" the framework states. \"The current rules dating back to the 1920s are no longer sufficient to ensure a fair allocation of taxing rights in an increasingly globalized world.\"The framework applies only to multinationals with annual revenues of about US$825 million or higher. It excludes manufacturing suppliers and resource extraction companies, like oil companies.As it stands, the framework appears to be a victory for large, consumption-heavy countries like the United States, China and much of Western Europe, and a loss for so-called tax havens, like Ireland. Advancing the negotiating process is a win for large multinationals, even though a final deal could put them on the hook to pay more in taxes, because the alternative appears to be a series of country-by-country digital taxes that could be expensive to comply with.\"Amazon welcomes the publication of these proposals by the OECD, which are an important step forward,\" a spokeswoman said on Wednesday in an email. \"Reaching broad international agreement on changes to fundamental international tax principles is critical to limit the risk of double taxation and distortive unilateral measures and to provide an environment that fosters growth in global trade, which is vital for the millions of customers and sellers that Amazon supports around the globe.\"A Treasury Department spokesman said Wednesday that the United States \"is studying the OECD Secretariat's proposal and is actively engaged in the process aimed at forging a consensus on international tax issues\" before reiterating the administration's opposition \"to unilateral digital services taxes.\"The framework will be taken up for discussion by finance ministers from large countries, who are due to meet in Washington next week.NYTIMES[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "MARK Zuckerberg is one of the world's richest men and he runs one of the world's most important companies. But last week, the Facebook boss made an unusually unpleasant discovery. Someone had secretly made two hours' worth of audio recordings at internal staff meetings he addressed in July and sent the lot to tech news website The Verge.This was striking for two reasons, starting with the leak itself. Facebook has about 40,000 employees and Mr Zuckerberg has held weekly Q&A sessions with thousands of them for years. Although news drips out occasionally, it rarely gushes forth in the form of a two-hour recording.Without knowing who did the leaking or why, it is impossible to know if the disclosure means staff are growing more disillusioned with their leader.But if they were, it would not be a shock.\n",

      "And no wonder the line of people calling for a break-up of his empire, which includes Instagram and WhatsApp, has spread beyond politicians to his old university friend and Facebook co-founder, Chris Hughes.'SECURITY AND CIVILITY FOR CLICKS'As Mr Hughes wrote this year, Mr Zuckerberg's focus on growth had \"led him to sacrifice security and civility for clicks\" and his \"staggering\" influence was unchecked because he controls more than half Facebook's voting shares.That underlines a more troubling aspect of the leaked audio. Mr Zuckerberg's staff address inadvertently reveals the extraordinary self-belief that has made him such a remarkable entrepreneur, yet threatens to be his undoing.At one point, he was asked how he was able to balance his financial responsibility to shareholders with his moral responsibility to society. He answered with a story about a defining moment in his life: the decision he took in 2006 at the age of 22 not to sell his two-year-old social network to Yahoo for US$1 billion. Facebook has a market value of US$500 billion today, but back then, his move seemed mad.As Mr Zuckerberg told his staff, the group's 10 million users were dwarfed by the 100 million at rival network, MySpace, which was growing faster. \"Our board was super upset,\" he said. \"Our whole management team basically quit.\" He was told by \"all these experienced people\" he would regret his decision for the rest of his life.Surviving a moment like that at the age of 22, he said, \"leaves you with a lot of confidence that you can make long-term decisions and that they can work out over time\".The thing was, he added, if he had not kept control of his company he might have been fired for a decision like that, or others that led to Facebook suffering one of the worst one-day stock market wipeouts in US history.\"We wouldn't even be here if I didn't have control,\" he said. \"Over the long term, it really is profitable to do the right thing.\"The trouble is, Mr Zuckerberg's definition of \"the right thing\" looks increasingly strained. Under his rule, Facebook has earned a reputation for a sluggish response to criticism and sometimes, outright denial. It does not help that he has repeatedly ignored requests to testify before British and Canadian Members of Parliament investigating his group's behaviour.UNSHAKEABLE CONFIDENCEThere was a time when his unshakeable confidence could impress the giants of his industry. In his book, Becoming Facebook, Mike Hoefflinger, a former executive at the company, tells of a 2009 meeting between Mr Zuckerberg and Silicon Valley statesman Andy Grove, the late head of Intel. One of Mr Grove's first questions was: \"How did you turn down Yahoo's US$1 billion?\"Mr Zuckerberg replied: \"I just thought we could do it.\" In that answer, writes Mr Hoefflinger, \"one visionary CEO with willpower recognised another across a chasm of nearly two generations\". That was 2009.In 2019, Mr Zuckerberg's willpower remains undimmed. But so does the fact that it has clouded his vision to the point that it may yet lead to his downfall.

      "[SAN FRANCISCO] Pioneering digital payments firm PayPal on Friday said it is abandoning an alliance intended to oversee the Facebook-backed Libra cryptocurrency, which has come under attack by regulators.This makes the California-based company the first member to exit the group.PayPal said in a statement it would forgo any further participation in the group - the Geneva-based Libra Association - and would instead focus on its own core businesses.\"We remain supportive of Libra's aspirations and look forward to continued dialogue on ways to work together in the future,\" PayPal added.\n",

      "\"It requires a certain boldness and fortitude to take on an endeavor as ambitious as Libra - a generational opportunity to get things right and improve financial inclusion,\" Libra Association's head of policy Dante Disparte said in response to an AFP inquiry.\"The journey will be long and challenging. We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now, rather than later.\"Facebook unveiled plans in June for Libra - which will roll out in 2020 - to be backed by a basket of currency assets to avoid the wild swings of Bitcoin and other virtual units.The non-profit Libra Association, based in Geneva, will oversee the blockchain-based coin.Facebook envisions Libra as a new global cryptocurrency, pledging to deliver a stable virtual money that lives on smartphones and could bring over a billion \"unbanked\" people into the financial system.\"The type of change that will reconfigure the financial system to be tilted towards people, not the institutions serving them, will be hard,\" Mr Disparte said.\"Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else.\"Mastercard, Visa and other financial partners enlisted to oversee Libra are also reportedly having second thoughts in their involvement in Libra, as regulators unleash ire on the project and dig for information from members of the association.France and Germany last month pledged to block Libra from operating in Europe and backed the development of a public cryptocurrency instead.With the exit of PayPal, Libra Association now has 28 members, including ride-hailing apps Uber Technologies and Lyft, as well as Spotify Technologies.\"We look forward to the first Libra Council meeting in 10 days and will be sharing updates following that, including details of the 1,500 entities that have indicated enthusiastic interest to participate,\" Libra Association said in a tweet. The head of the association said last week that the project's leaders aimed to \"reassure\" regulators worried about the virtual money.In leaked comments from a meeting of Facebook employees in July, Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said he remained optimistic about Libra despite harsh comments from public officials in several countries.\"The public things, I think, tend to be a little more dramatic,\" he said.\"But a bigger part of it is private engagement with regulators around the world, and those, I think, often, are more substantive and less dramatic... That's where a lot of the discussions and details get hashed out on things.\"COOK'S VIEWIn an interview published Friday in French newspaper Les Echos, Apple chief executive Tim Cook said he was uncomfortable with the idea of a company taking over roles typically reserved for governments.Without specifically naming Facebook, Mr Cook said issuing currency, like national defence, is best left to states.Facebook and some two dozen partners released a prototype of Libra as an open source code for developers interested in weaving it into apps, services or businesses.Martin Chorzempa, a research fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, questioned whether Libra would be able to fulfill its vision.In particular, Libra will need to comply with regulations that require collecting personal information about customers in order to expose crimes such as money laundering or fraud.\"It is not clear to me that Libra is anywhere near being able to perform those know-your-customer requirements that would allow them to legally serve these communities,\" Mr Chorzempa said.\"Libra would have to work with governments to make sure they are compliant or get those rules changed, and that is a difficult process.\"AFP, REUTERS[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "\"We're going to lose the ability to find those kids who need to be rescued,\" Mr Wray said. \"We're going to lose the ability to find the bad guys.\"The Justice Department's No 2 official, who spoke after Mr Wray, took a swipe at Apple Inc, which already uses end-to-end encryption on its messenger, saying the company reported only 43 tips to law enforcement last year about child exploitation.Facebook, by contrast, reported globally 16 million child-exploitation tips, a number that he said could drop by as much as 70 per cent if Facebook encrypts its messaging program the way Apple has done.\"Are we to assume that Apple magically ran platforms free of child exploitation?\" Deputy Attorney General Jeff Rosen asked. \"Or is it that companies with end-to-end encryption cannot see harmful illicit activity that was occurring on these platforms and they choose to avert their eyes by deploying end-to-end encryption?\"The Justice Department event is part of a renewed push by the American, Australian, and British governments to force tech companies to help them circumvent the encryption that helps keeps digital communications secure.Debates over encryption have been rumbling for more than 25 years, but officials' anxiety has increased as major tech companies move toward automatically encrypting the messages on their platforms and the data held on phones.In the past, officials have cited the threat of terrorism to buttress their campaigns again encryption. But as Islamic State and other extremist groups fade from the headlines, governments are trying a different tack, invoking the threat of child abuse to argue for \"lawful access\" to these devices.Facebook's privacy-focused move, announced by founder and chief executive Mark Zuckerberg this year, is causing particular consternation because the platform is the source of millions of tips to authorities about child abuse images every year.Mr Zuckerberg, speaking on the company's weekly internal Q&A livestream on Thursday, defended the decision, saying he was \"optimistic\" Facebook would be able to identify predators even in encrypted systems by using the same tools it uses to fight election interference.Many people have applauded Facebook's push for privacy and security. Academics, experts, and privacy groups have long worried that circumventing the protections around private communications would open dangerous vulnerabilities that could make the entire internet less safe, and leave billions of users exposed to abusive surveillance.Attorney General William Barr, who also spoke at Friday's event, said the Justice Department \"would like to engage with the private sector in exploring solutions\", but he warned that time is running out because the deployment of \"warrant-proof encryption has accelerated\".\"The status quo is exceptionally dangerous, unacceptable, and only getting worse,\" he said.Daniel Castro, vice-president of the Washington-based Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, said in an interview ahead of Mr Wray's speech that government officials were framing the conversation around protecting children because it's emotionally powerful.\"In the past they've really focused on terrorism,\" he said. \"They've really switched angles on that.\" REUTERS[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

The number of known child sexual abuse images has soared from thousands to tens of millions in just the past few years.Speaking at an event in Washington on Wednesday, Associate Attorney General Sujit Raman said the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children received more than 18 million tips of online child sex abuse last year, over 90 per cent of them from Facebook.He estimated that up to 75 per cent of those tips would \"go dark\" if social media companies like Facebook were to go through with encryption plans.Facebook said in a statement that it strongly opposes \"government efforts to build backdoors\", which it said would undermine privacy and security.Antigone Davis, Facebook's global head of safety, told Reuters the company was looking at ways to prevent inappropriate behavior and stop predators from connecting with children.This approach \"offers us an opportunity to prevent harms in a way that simply going after content doesn't\", she said.In practice, the bilateral agreement would empower the UK government to directly request data from US tech companies, which remotely store data relevant to their own ongoing criminal investigations, rather than asking for it via US law enforcement officials.The effort represents a two-pronged approach by the United States and its allies to pressure private technology companies while making information sharing about criminal investigations faster.A representative for the US Department of Justice declined to comment.The letter addressed to Zuckerberg and Facebook comes from US Attorney-General William Barr, UK Secretary of State for the Home Department Priti Patel and Australian Minister of Home Affairs Peter Dutton.\"Our understanding is that much of this activity, which is critical to protecting children and fighting terrorism, will no longer be possible if Facebook implements its proposals as planned,\" the letter reads.\"Unfortunately, Facebook has not committed to address our serious concerns about the impact its proposals could have on protecting our most vulnerable citizens.\"WhatsApp's global head Will Cathcart wrote in a public internet forum on Saturday that the company \"will always oppose government attempts to build backdoors because they would weaken the security of everyone who uses WhatsApp including governments themselves\".That app, which is already encrypted, is also owned by Facebook.REUTERS[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "[LUXEMBOURG] Facebook Inc may be ordered to patrol its platform across the world to remove offensive and defamatory posts by users in the European Union, the bloc's highest court ruled in another landmark privacy decision.European courts can force platforms such as the social-network giant to seek and destroy such content once they've been alerted, the EU Court of Justice in Luxembourg said in a binding decision on Thursday. Courts can also order a worldwide removal as long as they take international law into account when they issue the edicts, the judges said.Platforms from Facebook to Google's YouTube won a nod of approval from the EU earlier this year for tackling hate speech posted online as part of a code of conduct signed with the commission in 2016. The companies vowed to tackle online hate speech within 24 hours, once made aware of it.Despite the platforms' efforts, EU officials have been mulling new bloc-wide rules, building on existing legislation in Germany, that could hit big tech firms with possible fines if they fail to remove illegal hate speech quickly enough. The discussions fit into broader plans by the EU to overhaul liability rules for platforms.\n",

He said he hoped \"the first results\" would come by the end of that year.But nearly 18 months later, much of the data remains unavailable to academics because Facebook said it has struggled to share the information while also protecting its users' privacy. And the information the company eventually releases is expected to be far less comprehensive than originally described.\n",

      "BuzzFeed News earlier reported on researchers' concerns over delays in Facebook's data-sharing project.\"Silicon Valley has a moral obligation to do all it can to protect the American political process,\" said Dipayan Ghosh, a fellow at the Shorenstein Center at Harvard and a former privacy and public policy adviser at Facebook. \"We need researchers to have access to study what went wrong.\"Political disinformation campaigns have continued to grow since the 2016 campaign. Last week, Oxford researchers said that the number of countries with disinformation campaigns more than doubled to 70 in the last two years, and that Facebook remained the No 1 platform for those campaigns.But while company executives express an eagerness to prevent the spread of knowingly false posts and photos on the social network, by far the world's largest, they also face numerous questions about their ability to secure people's private information.Revelations last year that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm, had harvested the personal data of up to 87 million Facebook users set off an outcry in Washington.In the months after the scandal, Facebook cut off many of the most common avenues for researchers accessing information about the more than two billion people on the service. This past July, it also agreed with federal regulators to pay US$5 billion for mishandling users' personal information.\"At one level, it's difficult as there's a large amount of data and Facebook has concerns around privacy,\" said Tom Glaisyer, chairman of the group of seven nonprofits supporting the research efforts. \"But frankly, our digital public square doesn't appear to be serving our democracy,\" added Mr Glaisyer, who is also managing director of the Democracy Fund, a nonpartisan group that promotes election security.Three months after Mr Zuckerberg spoke in Washington last year, Facebook announced plans to provide approved researchers with detailed information about users, like age and location, where a false post appeared in their feeds and even their friends' ideological affiliation. Dozens of researchers applied to get the information.The company partnered with an independent research commission, Social Science One, which had been set up for the initiative, to determine what information could be sent to researchers. Facebook and Social Science One also brought in the Social Science Research Council, an independent nonprofit organisation that oversees international social science research, to sort through applications from academics and conduct a peer review and an ethical review on their research proposals.But privacy experts brought in by Social Science One quickly raised concerns about disclosing too much personal information. In response, Facebook began trying to apply what's known in statistics and data analytics as \"differential privacy\", in which researchers can learn a lot about a group from data, but virtually nothing about a specific individual. It is a method that has been adopted by directors at the Census Bureau and promoted by Apple.Facebook is still working on that effort. But researchers said that even when Facebook delivers the data, what they can learn about activity on the social network will be much more limited than they planned for.\"We and Facebook have learned how difficult it is to make\" a database that was not just privacy-protected but at a \"grand scale\", said Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor and co-founder of Social Science One.Facebook said researchers had access to other data sets, including from its ads archive and Crowdtangle, a news-tracking tool that Facebook owns. Two researchers said they and others visited Facebook's headquarters in California in June to learn how to study the available data set.And both Facebook and Social Science One said they would continue to make more data available to researchers in time. In September, the two released 32 million links that included data about whether users labelled millions of posts as fake news, spam or hate speech, or if fact-check organisations raised doubts about the posts' accuracy. It also included how many times stories were shared publicly and the countries where the stories were most shared.Facebook's effort is a \"tremendous step forward\", said Joshua Tucker, a professor at New York University studying the spread of polarising content across multiple platforms. \"In the long term, if methods for making these data available for outside research are successfully implemented, it will have a very positive impact.\"But other researchers said the existing databases are severely limiting. And some said that Facebook's concerns about privacy are overblown.Ariel Sheen, a doctoral student at Universidad Pontificia Bolivariana in Medellin, Colombia, whose research team has been through the Social Science One approval process but has not yet received the data, said his group has uncovered on its own hints of a large coordinated campaign in Venezuela.His group believes it has found more than 3,000 still-active fake Facebook accounts - profiles run by people impersonating others, for example - that are spreading false information. The accounts, Mr Sheen said, are tied to Telesur, a Latin American television network largely financed by the Venezuela government.But because Facebook is not providing the original data described, Mr Sheen noted, his team's work cannot proceed as planned. \"We believe that it is imperative for our research to continue as was originally agreed to by Facebook,\" he added.

      "\"When we (made) the announcement in June, that was our North Star,\" Mr Perez said of the June 2020 launch date, adding that a delay of one or two quarters would not be an issue. \"What is important is that we need to comply with the regulators and we need to make sure that they are on board with us and fully comfortable with our solutions.\"\"We knew that we would have to answer lots of questions coming from regulators on both sides of the Atlantic, and from other parts of the world,\" he added in an interview at the United Nations offices in Geneva.Libra, announced as Facebook expands into e-commerce, will be backed by a reserve of real-world assets, including bank deposits and short-term government securities, and overseen by the 28-member association.The structure is intended to foster trust and stabilise the price volatility that plagues cryptocurrencies and renders them impractical for commerce and payments.Last week, David Marcus, the executive leading the project at Facebook, said the company still aimed to launch the digital currency in 2020.\"The goal is still to launch Libra next year,\" he told Swiss newspaper NZZ. \"Until then, we'll need to address all questions adequately, create a suitable regulatory environment.\"The association has thus far taken a backseat to Facebook in visibility on the project, but Mr Perez stressed it was independent of the social media giant, which will have an equal vote as other members in the association's decision-making.Other members of the association include Vodafone, PayPal, Mastercard and Visa, and the group plans to bring more members on board in the near future, which it expects to include banks.\"It's known this project was incubated at Facebook and started at Facebook, but at an early stage, there was a decision that this should be a public good not controlled by a single entity,\" added Mr Perez, a senior director of payments engineering for PayPal before starting at Libra this May.\"The Libra Association is clearly an association and not a subsidiary of Facebook.\" REUTERS[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "\"We will gather feedback to understand whether this change will improve people's experiences,\" said Mr Jimmy Raimo, a Facebook spokesman. He added that the site wanted to be a place where people felt comfortable expressing themselves.For years, Internet health advocates have pushed Facebook to stop prioritising Like counts, arguing that the metrics have a negative impact on people's self-esteem.\"We know that kids seek validation via the Like button. We know that it can negatively affect kids' and teenagers' self-esteem,\" said Mr Jim Steyer, chief executive of the non-profit Common Sense Media.\"The public is finally waking up to how many of these tactics can be manipulative.\"Facebook has also been under fire for the amount of extreme content on its site and the effect those posts and videos have on people's lives.As users have tried to draw attention for their posts, they have livestreamed killings on the social network and posted conspiracy theories.Social media influencers have also racked up Likes - sometimes by purchasing them - and made money by promoting products to their followers.Instagram, the photo-sharing site owned by Facebook, also began hiding some Likes and other metrics this year as part of an experiment intended to make users feel happier about the time they spend on the platform.Mr Adam Mosseri, who runs Instagram, told BuzzFeed News in April that people often worried about not getting a high enough number of Likes on their photos.Under the experiment, people could still see the number of likes on their own posts, but the number was not publicly displayed.This could create \"a less pressurised environment where people feel comfortable expressing themselves\", Mr Mosseri said at the time.At Instagram, the change was inspired partly by the rising popularity of Stories, where people post photos and videos that expire after 24 hours.Views and reactions to Instagram Stories have always been private.Instagram Stories emulates the Stories feature of Snapchat, the social media platform whose chief executive, Mr Evan Spiegel, has talked publicly about not using online measurements to incentivise people's behaviour.In Australia, Facebook said it planned to study whether users would continue to comment and to Like posts even if they could not see the number of their peers who were also doing so.NYTimes[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "[SAN FRANCISCO] Facebook Inc agreed to acquire CTRL-Labs, a technology startup that is building software to let people control a digital avatar using only their thoughts. The world's largest social network is paying between US$500 million and US$1 billion, according to people familiar with the deal.The closely held four-year-old startup, which has dozens of employees and has raised tens of millions in venture capital, uses a bracelet to measure neuron activity in a subject's arm to determine movement that person is thinking about, even if they aren't physically moving. That neuron activity is then translated into movement on a digital screen. Facebook declined to comment on the price of the acquisition.Technology like CTRL-Labs's may someday be a crucial part of products like augmented reality glasses, where a user might want to control a computer without the need for buttons or a keyboard.\"Your hands could be in your pocket, behind you,\" explained Thomas Reardon, chief executive officer of CTRL-Labs, at an industry conference last December. \"It's the intention (to move), not the movement\" itself that controls the avatar, he said.\n",

That was far bigger than the last number that Facebook had disclosed, of 400 app suspensions in August 2018.The extent of how many apps Facebook had cut off was revealed in court filings that were unsealed later on Friday by a state court in Boston, as part of an investigation by the Massachusetts attorney general into the technology company.\n",

      "The disclosures about app suspensions renew questions about whether people's personal information on Facebook is secure, even after the company has been under fire for more than a year for its privacy practices.Facebook apps can take on a variety of forms, from music apps such as Spotify to games like Candy Crush. Some apps use Facebook simply so that people can log in to their service or product, which otherwise has nothing to do with the social network. The common denominator is that these apps want access to information about Facebook members so that they can add new users.As the world's largest social network, Facebook has data of more than two billion people. But it showed that it had failed to safeguard some of that information when Cambridge Analytica took some of the data without people's permission in 2016 and built voter profiles from it for the Trump presidential campaign, which The New York Times and The Observer in London reported on last year. Facebook said that as many as 87 million users' information could have been retrieved.The social network has since faced lawsuits, regulatory scrutiny and the ire of lawmakers around the world over whether it can safeguard its users' data trove. The Justice Department and the FBI are investigating Cambridge Analytica. Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive, has appeared in Congress to testify on the matter. Mr Zuckerberg, who visited Washington this week and met with President Donald Trump, also apologised for the improper handling of user data and vowed changes. That included auditing all of Facebook's third-party apps to make sure they were not abusing people's information.\"Every company, and especially the app developers involved, needs to understand that there are consequences for abusing consumer data,\" said Jules Polonetsky, chief executive of the Future of Privacy Forum, a non-profit organisation focused on issues of data privacy and scholarship. \"If these apps escape legal penalty, developers are left thinking there is no legal risk, privacy is solely a platform responsibility and a terms of service agreement with Facebook.\"Mr Polonetsky called for the Federal Trade Commission to act quickly against developers who broke Facebook's terms of service around customer data.The latest revelations follow a settlement that Facebook struck with the FTC in July over privacy violations, in which the company agreed to pay a record US$5 billion fine and to increase oversight into its data-handling practices. Some critics claimed at the time that the FTC's settlement did not go far enough in protecting consumers and the agency faced new calls to take a harder line on the social network.\"Facebook put up a neon sign that said 'Free Private Data,' and let app developers have their fill of Americans' personal info,\" Senator Ron Wyden said on Friday. \"The FTC needs to hold Mark Zuckerberg personally responsible.\"The Silicon Valley company has been duelling with the Massachusetts Attorney General's Office to keep documents related to its app investigation out of the public eye. The state prosecutor began examining Facebook's data sharing practices in early 2018 after the Cambridge Analytica revelations broke and issued several civil subpoenas to the company for information. Last month, Facebook had petitioned a judge in Boston to seal the records. The seal was lifted on Friday.\"For nearly a year, Facebook has fought to shield information about improper data-sharing with app developers,\" Maura Healey, the Massachusetts attorney general, said in a statement.

      "\"If they want to have quality content for their users, which they say they want to have, they're going to have to come up with a more broadly sustainable business model for publishers than handing out candy every once in a while,\" said David Chavern of the News Media Alliance trade group, which represents 2,000 news organisations and has been critical of tech companies.Much of the way news currently surfaces is due to algorithms, which have been trained to identify important news. But some signals that a story might be important - like lots of people sharing it or clicking on it - don't necessarily mean it's real news. And the systems can also be tricked.Critics have lambasted Google and Facebook for the role their platforms played in amplifying a Russian disinformation campaign around the 2016 US presidential election, saying the companies were slow to identify the foreign interference and didn't do enough to point users toward quality journalism.With the 2020 election around the corner, the companies say they are working on how to better address fake news stories, deceptive social media accounts and deepfake videos powered by artificial intelligence.At the same time, politicians including US President Donald Trump have accused Google, Facebook and other major tech companies of anti-conservative bias in the way the platforms surface news.With the new changes, companies appear to be realising that humans may need to play a bigger role in helping identify quality news.Google says its has instructed its human raters to prioritise news reports that display a high degree of skill, time and effort.To evaluate trustworthiness, raters are told that \"prestigious awards, such as the Pulitzer Prize award, or a history of high quality original reporting are strong evidence of positive reputation\".It's not clear how that will play out, particularly with local publications, which rarely have the resources to compete in national journalism contests but are often the only professional news source in a given area.In response to questions about Facebook's approach to news, a spokesman referenced an internal memo about News Tab obtained by The Information, which stated that editors \"will seek to promote the media outlet that first reported a particular news story, and additionally prioritise stories broken by local news outlets\".Should the story be covered nationally or internationally, the human editors will then make subsequent decisions about the developments.Employment in newspaper newsrooms has declined by nearly half since 2008 as readers turn to free news content and entertainment gleaned from platforms like Google and Facebook. Local news, in particular, has been hit by the collapsing news media ecosystem, with fewer customers willing to spend subscription dollars.While Mr Chavern of the News Media Alliance trade group lauded Google and Facebook's US$300 million commitments, he said it won't be enough to reinvigorate the news industry before the 2020 election.He also said that it is possible that the new approaches could discourage outlets from attributing or hat-tipping each other's reporting in an attempt to look the most \"original\" to the companies' algorithms.\"The current algorithms punish investments and promote copying,\" said Mr Chavern. \"That's the baseline.\"WP[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "The fire was real, but Mrs Tananbaum is skeptical about whether there was much point in getting sucked into the drama unfolding post by post, from the fire trucks' arrival to the moment students were permitted back into the dorms.\"When I went to college, we had a lot of fire alarms in my dorm, and my parents didn't know about them and I was fine and they were fine,\" she said.Mrs Tananbaum sees the Facebook group as a \"curse and a blessing\": useful for advice for move-in day and for local recommendations, like when her son injured a finger and needed an orthopedist.It's also reassuring to read a range of emotions, she said, whether parents miss their children terribly or worry because they're homesick. \"It's nice to know that whatever you or your kids are feeling, someone else is feeling the same way,\" Mrs Tananbaum said.Still it sometimes feels as if she's getting too much information. \"These groups make it very easy for parents to get involved,\" she said. \"I think, Do we really need to know any of this?\"Whether they are an inevitable sign of hyper-connected times or something closer to next-level helicopter parenting, Facebook groups for parents of college students are on the rise. So far in 2019, more than 200,000 people have joined university parent groups on Facebook in the United States, a 50 per cent jump from this time last year, according to Leonard Lam, a company spokesman.The groups, usually created by a parent and without university involvement, are a gathering spot for the parents or guardians of a particular school's students. There are also groups arranged by class year, student major or other interests, like \"Parents of College Athletes\", \"Moms of an 'Only Child' Away at College\" and \"It's All Greek to Me! Parents of College Greeks.\"Elin Hilderbrand, the novelist, joined the University of South Carolina's parent Facebook group last year, after her son enrolled. \"I had to Google 'DS' and 'DD', \" Mrs Hilderbrand said. \"I thought it was a Southern thing.\" (For the uninitiated: DS is shorthand for darling son, DD is darling daughter.)From her home in Nantucket, Massachusetts — also the setting for several of her beachy romance novels — Mrs Hilderbrand was transfixed by posts about the intense world of sorority rush at the university, where first-year female students arrive a week before the school year begins to advance through elimination rounds in hopes of a bid.\"I'm fascinated by sorority rush. It sounds brutal.... The girls seem to have it much harder?\" Mrs Hilderbrand posted.Responses poured in, and Mrs Hilderbrand couldn't stop reading. \"There were literally hundreds of stories about the way the girls have to get up at six in the morning and get their hose on,\" she said.\"There were mothers on there who were completely heartbroken — 'My daughter was a legacy and she didn't get in and her best friend and her roommate got in.' Every comment was a novel, and it was breaking my heart.\"Parents also rely on college groups to ask about mattress toppers, frown on difficult professors (\"My daughter is very good in math, but her professor isn't teaching at all,\" read a recent post in a Clemson mothers group), arrange \"care-package parties\" and set up parent \"sip and sobs\" near campus after drop-off.Some look for help finding their children roommates; others complain about them. There are bucking Buckeyes. \"I need a little advice!\" read a recent post on the Ohio State University (OSU) Parents group.\"My daughter called me at 5.30am saying she had been sitting in the common room since 3am because while she was asleep her roommate had came in and woke her up because she was having sex in the room!\"No question is too trivial. A parent in a University of New Hampshire group wondered: \"What kind of shower caddy do boys use?\"In an era when some parents are spending thousands of dollars to turn their children's dorm rooms into cushy retreats with upholstered headboards and giant flat-screen TVs, expectations are high.\"People get incensed, like 'I pay x amount of dollars and I can't believe the quality of the food or the dorms,' \" said Samantha Moran, who is in parent groups for two universities, Tulane and Elon.\"I don't need my kids to have a climbing wall. There's a part of me that's secretly happy that they're living in a cinder-block dorm and eating bad food. That's part of college.\"For many parents, the groups are a source of support, community and identity. Dee Dee Becker is the administrator for Virginia Tech's parents Facebook group, which has more than 16,000 members, making it one of the largest groups of its kind on the platform. Mrs Becker estimated that she devotes 40 hours a week overseeing the group.She has helped direct freshman parents to answers of frequently asked questions, and has consulted with university officials when she doesn't have an answer to a question, such as when a parent recently asked if dart boards are allowed in dorm rooms. (No.)She also creates calendar events to build anticipation for football \"watch parties\", where parents enthusiastically comment with their reactions. When Mrs Becker's daughter came down with mono, a local mother in the group delivered ginger ale, crackers and an air mattress for Becker, while she made the drive from five hours away.Although Mrs Becker and her husband's daughter, their only child, graduated in May and moved out, Mrs Becker plans to continue as a Virginia Tech parent group administrator. \"There's no end in sight at the moment for me, though I think I'll know it when it's time,\" she said.Parent groups on Facebook are typically \"closed\", which means that only members can see posts. Administrators can opt to approve posts before they appear.Parents or family members who want to join usually answer a few screening questions to confirm that they have a student at the university. Administrators also try to keep out local solicitors like laundry-pickup services, alcohol-delivery businesses and \"rush consultants\", who will help would-be sorority members select their outfits for recruitment week. Students are not allowed.That didn't stop Cassidy Payne, who, when she was a senior at Virginia Tech, slipped past gatekeepers with a fake Facebook profile and wrote a satirical piece about the university's parent group for the site The Black Sheep Online.\"Little did we know that by the time we had settled into our dorm rooms and watched the family car roll away, our mothers and fathers had already become members of a secret society,\" Ms Payne wrote.The conclusion: \"Our parents will always be our parents, no matter if you're halfway across the globe or a two hour drive down 81. And they have no shame in asking for recommendations for the best cures of explosive diarrhoea for their DS or DD.\"She may have a point. Parents do need to differentiate between enabling and empowering, said Julie Lythcott-Haims, a former dean of freshmen at Stanford University and the author of \"How to Raise an Adult\". For example, there's nothing wrong with parents having a shortlist of contacts near the school, made through a parent group, in case of emergencies, she said.\"Let's just not classify everything as an emergency,\" Mrs Lythcott-Haims said. A cold does not require parent intervention, she noted. \"In that circumstance the dorm staff is the resource, and you can tell your kid, 'Honey, have your RA help you out — that's why they're there.' \"Over the past decade, more colleges and universities have recognised that parents have unique needs, at a time when concerns about campus safety and mental health issues are high, and some institutions are taking an active role in Facebook parent groups. Two years ago, Maureen Hurley, the director of parent and family programs at Emerson College, created a Parents and Families of Newly Accepted Students group.\"It was an experiment to see if we were able to help families communicate with the school in an easier way than their picking up the phone or writing an email with basic questions like 'What size bedsheets do we need?'\" Mrs Hurley said.She said that the group has been a success. In a poll of families about where they got most of their information, the Parent and Family Facebook group ranked highest, above the school website or families' own students. Mrs Hurley has used features like Facebook Live to help answer parent questions, like when she gave a video tour of the student health centre.In September, Mrs Hurley asks parents of the previous class to migrate to \"the big-kids table\" — the larger school parent group. However, the first group had formed a tight bond and created its own group, unmoderated by Emerson, for their students' class year.\"They didn't want to leave,\" Mrs Hurley said.NYTIMES[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "Facebook has faced a storm of controversy since the revelation early last year that Mr Trump's campaign benefited from the work of an app developer who started out by collecting personal information from 300,000 users, and later, from those users' friends. Unbeknownst to users, the developer shared the data trove with Cambridge Analytica, which used the information to target voters in 2016 with hyper-specific appeals through \"psychographic\" modelling.While Cambridge Analytica's research drew on as many as 87 million Facebook users, the ensuing lawsuits were filed on behalf of everyone in the US who uses the social network.A central allegation is that Facebook illegally exploited users who programmed their privacy settings to share data with \"friends only\". Facebook is accused of taking information about those users from their friends and wantonly turning it over to app developers to profit from the advertising they spawn.Facebook contends it disclosed its practices in user agreements. It has also argued that anyone sharing their information on a social network shouldn't count on holding onto their privacy.\"You have to closely guard something in order to have a reasonable expectation of privacy,\" the company's lawyer, Orin Snyder, told judge Chhabria at a May 29 hearing. \"There is no expectation of privacy when you go on a social media platform,\" the purpose of which is to share things with big groups of people, he said.The Cambridge Analytica scandal demonstrated in a \"dramatic way\" that Facebook can't control when an app developer breaks its own data-sharing agreement with the company, the lawyer said.\"You can't cry foul, that there's gambling going on in this establishment, when you've been warned,\" Mr Snyder told the judge.Lawyers for the users said in an emailed statement that they \"look forward to the discovery process that will prove our clients' claims.\"Facebook didn't immediately respond to an email request for comment.The case is In Re Facebook Consumer Privacy User Profile Litigation, 18-MD-02843, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California (San Francisco).BLOOMBERG[NEW YORK] Former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro dropped out of the presidential race after...[WASHINGTON] Confidence among US consumers climbed to the highest level in five months as Americans grew more...LIBRA Group on Thursday said it has entered into a legally-binding memorandum of understanding with Cascade Metals,...CATALIST-LISTED Malaysian-based automotive company MeGroup on Thursday said it has accepted a letter of offer from...[LONDON] A British employment tribunal began a landmark hearing Thursday on whether a strict form of veganism is a...SPH Digital News© 2020 SINGAPORE PRESS HOLDINGS LTD.

      "With Local Alerts, Facebook account holders in local government and among first responders such as the police and fire departments can send out messages that are then spread more widely by Facebook.It was not immediately clear how useful the service was in its pilot phase. When asked if Local Alerts to date have been deployed quickly enough to make a difference or have been employed in situations where users were in danger, Facebook declined to give examples, citing the privacy of its account holders.It also said the speed at which alerts were disseminated was dependent on the account holders. In one example, when a disgruntled student opened fire during the last day of classes at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte in April, the City of Charlotte Government's Facebook page sent a Local Alert notifying nearby residents when it was safe to return.The alert was posted more than two hours after the shooting, said Ken Brown, Charlotte's Interim Media Relations Manager.Some local authorities contacted by Reuters said they were using Local Alerts alongside other services to warn citizens of danger. Mt Juliet Police Department in Tennessee said it uses a combination of Facebook Local Alerts, mobile text messages through the Nixle platform, and posts on local community media service Nextdoor to send emergency notifications.The local authorities said they had sent alerts over emergencies including road closures, bad weather, and missing people.

Even though they are banned at home, many Chinese state media companies use them to advertise and put out news in English and Chinese.Twitter also said it would stop accepting advertising from state-run media worldwide.China has long exercised tight control of its domestic media, censoring news on certain topics and muzzling critical coverage of the government.Its control of the internet has intensified under President Xi Jinping, with restrictions on sending some political news via messaging apps and the deletion of thousands of social media posts in a \"Cleaning the Web\" campaign that began in 2014.PUBLIC IREThe removal of accounts also drew the ire of Chinese social media users.
